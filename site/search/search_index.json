How to access this service local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) Methods \u00b6 GenerateGUID string \u00b6 A randomly generated UUID (universally unique identifier) string. This is represented by a 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits. They are displayed in 5 groups with hyphens separating them. You'll get a total of 36 character, example: 12345-67890-abcde-fghij-klmno Parameter(s) Data wrapped boolean Whether the returned string should be wrapped in {curly braces} Return(s) Definition string The randomly generated UUIID. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local UUID = Http . Methods : GenerateGUID () print ( UUID ) --> Expected output: {12345-67890-abcde-fghij-klmno} Encode string \u00b6 The Encode function will convert your luau table into a JSON object or an array . Follow these guidelines: ( From ROBLOX's documentation ) Keys of the table must be either strings or numbers. If a table contains both, an array takes priority (string keys are ignored). An empty Lua table {} generates an empty JSON array. The value nil is never generated. Cyclic table references cause an error. This function allows values such as inf and nan , which are not valid JSON. This may cause problems if you want to use the outputted JSON elsewhere. Parameter(s) Data json_string string Your JSON string. Return(s) Definition Variant The returned luau table. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local LuaUTable = Http . Methods : Decode ( '{ \"Hello World!\": \"How are you today?\" }' ) print ( LuaUTable ) --> Expected output: { [\"Hello World!\"] = \"How are you today?\" } UrlEncode string \u00b6 The UrlEncode function will make sure that the reserved characters in the string which was given is properly encoded with % with two hexadecimal characters. Parameter(s) Data data string The string (URL) to encode. Return(s) Definition string The properly encoded string. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local Encoded = Http . Methods : UrlEncode ( 'Hello World!' ) print ( Encoded ) --> Expected output: Hello%20World Decode string \u00b6 The Encode function will convert your JSON object or an array table into a luau table. Follow these guidelines: ( From ROBLOX's documentation ) Keys of the table are strings or numbers but not both. If a JSON object contains both, string keys are ignored. An empty JSON object generates an empty Lua table {} . If the input string is not a valid JSON object, this function will throw an error. Parameter(s) Data json_string string Your JSON string. Return(s) Definition Variant The returned luau table. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local LuaUTable = Http . Methods : Decode ( '{ \"Hello World!\": \"How are you today?\" }' ) print ( LuaUTable ) --> Expected output: { [\"Hello World!\"] = \"How are you today?\" } UrlEncodeList string \u00b6 The UrlEncodeList will convert your list into a properly encoded. Same functionality as above. Parameter(s) Data data Variant The luau list to be encoded. Return(s) Definition string The properly encoded luau list. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local Encoded = Http . Methods : UrlEncode ({ 'Hello' , [ 'Lua' ] = 'World!' }) print ( Encoded ) --> Expected output: 1=Hello&Lua=World%21 Http \u00b6 Constructers \u00b6 new() Return(s) a New Request object. Parameter(s) Data url string The URL to be used for making Get / Post requests. getasync_data Variant Data to be used when making a GetAsync request. postasync_data Variant Data to be used when making a PostAsync request. getasync_data table format { nocache , headers } postasync_data table format { content_type , compress , headers , data } These values can be set before being used in a GetAsync/PostAsync request. GetAsync Variant \u00b6 The GetAsync will send out a HTTP GET request. This does all of the heavy lifting for you. Parameter(s) Data nocache boolean Weather if you want the request to cache the response. Defualt value: false headers Variant Used to specify HTTP request headers. Return(s) Definition Variant GET request's response data. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local HttpObject = Http . new ( 'https://google.com' ) local data = HttpObject : GetAsync () print ( data . success , data . data ) --> Expected output: true, *html data of that webpage* PostAsync Variant \u00b6 The PostAsync will send out a HTTP POST request. Very similar to GetAsync Parameter(s) Data data string Data to be sent to that specific URL. Data MUST be encoded before being used. Use Http.Methods:Encode(list) to help you. content_type HttpContentType Modifies the value in the Content-Type header sent with the request. compress boolean Determines whether the data is compressed (gzipped) when sent. Defualt value: false headers Variant Used to specify HTTP request headers. Return(s) Definition Variant POST request's request result.

Very useful when you are getting JSON data from a website. Inherits the same parameters from GetAsync Return(s) Definition Variant A luau list returned from a API request. Code Example local Http = Utility : GetService ( 'Http' ) local HttpObject = Http . new ( 'https://google.com' ) local data = HttpObject : GetAsync () print ( data ) --> Expected output: { ['somevalue'] = 'something' ... } PostAsyncAPI_UrlEncoded Variant \u00b6 Sends a PostAsync request with the data provided. Automatically URL converts the luau list. Parameter(s) Data data Variant A luau list to be POSTED to that URL. Already encodes the data.
